Feature: Rotate words
  In order to switch between common variations of a word
  As an Emacs user and parrot lover
  I want to rotate text

  Background:
    Given I switch to buffer "*parrot*"
    And the buffer is empty

  Scenario: Lowercase rotation
    Given I set parrot-rotate-dict to ((:rot ("snek" "snake")))
    And I insert:
    """
    this_is_snek_charmer_stawp
    """
    And I place the cursor between "is_" and "snek"
    And I call "parrot-rotate-next-word-at-point"
    Then I should see:
    """
    this_is_snake_charmer_stawp
    """
    Then the cursor should be between "is_" and "snake"

  Scenario: Next and previous rotations with wrapping
    Given I set parrot-rotate-dict to ((:rot ("shiba-inu" "such_animate" "wow")))
    And I insert:
    """
    shiba-inu
    """
    And I go to word "shiba-inu"
    And I call "parrot-rotate-next-word-at-point"
    Then I should see:
    """
    such_animate
    """
    And I call "parrot-rotate-next-word-at-point"
    Then I should see:
    """
    wow
    """
    And I call "parrot-rotate-next-word-at-point"
    Then I should see:
    """
    shiba-inu
    """
    And I call "parrot-rotate-prev-word-at-point"
    Then I should see:
    """
    wow
    """
    And I call "parrot-rotate-prev-word-at-point"
    Then I should see:
    """
    such_animate
    """
    And I call "parrot-rotate-prev-word-at-point"
    Then I should see:
    """
    shiba-inu

  Scenario: Jump to rotation on the right
    Given I set parrot-rotate-dict to ((:rot ("hunt" "stunt")))
